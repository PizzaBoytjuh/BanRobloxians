Just a webserver to store banned robloxians (yes, it's in a .txt file and the auth password isn't encrypted, but you're allowed to fix that yourself!)
Might not be that good/clean, this is my first project written with typescript instead of javascript

Roblox model file/lua file in [releases](https://github.com/PizzaBoytjuh/BanRobloxians/releases/latest)
<h1>Build</h1>
You can easily build the server with npx tsc (if you already have ts-node), then do node app.js to start execution.

# TODO
> Rewrite in GO
>
> Add SQLite support
