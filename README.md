Just a webserver to store banned robloxians (yes, it's in a .txt file and the auth password isn't encrypted, but you're allowed to fix that yourself!)
Might not be that good/clean, this is my first project written with typescript instead of javascript

I will add the .rbxm script later
<h1>Build</h1>
You can easily build the server with npx tsc, then do node app.js to start execution.

Dependencies:
>expressjs (npm i express)
>
>ts-node (npm i ts-node)
